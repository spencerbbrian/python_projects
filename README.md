### PYTHON PROJECTS
This is a repository for all projects I have worked on to improve my python skills a developer.
Below is a list of all the projects in this repo.
1. Guess_the_number.
    # Instructions
    This is one of the simple python projects yet an exciting one. You can even call it a mini-game. This project is particularly useful for beginners. Make a program in which the computer randomly chooses a number between 1 to 10, 1 to 100, or any range. Then give users a hint to guess the number. Every time the user guesses wrong, he gets another clue, and his score gets reduced. The clue can be multiples, divisible, greater or smaller, or a combination of all.You will also need functions to compare the inputted number with the guessed number, to compute the difference between the two, and to check whether an actual number was inputted or not in this python project. The main aim of this coding project idea from the Python projects list is to introduce beginners to coding basics.
